Translations at scale.

## Documentation

The NGX Translate Toolkit is an angular library designed to extend `@ngx-translate/core` and streamline the process of managing translations in **large Angular projects**.

It provides a set of tools and utilities to help developers easily integrate and maintain translations, making it simpler to create multilingual applications on projects where multiple Angular applications and libraries share common translation files.

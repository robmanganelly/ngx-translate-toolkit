# NGX Translate Toolkit

## Overview

The NGX Translate Toolkit is an angular library designed to streamline the process of managing translations in projects involving several Angular applications and libraries. It provides a set of tools and utilities to help developers easily integrate and maintain translations, making it simpler to create multilingual applications.

> Even though the toolkit can work with any Angular project, it is particularly beneficial for large-scale applications or monorepos where multiple Angular applications and libraries share common translation files, especially on micro-frontends.

This library aims to extend the capabilities of `@ngx-translate/core` library by providing additional features and utilities that enhance the translation experience in Angular projects. **It is not meant to replace it** You will still need to install `@ngx-translate/core` in your project to use this toolkit.
